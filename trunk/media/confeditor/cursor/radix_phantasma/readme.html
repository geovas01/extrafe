    description: Cursors are semi-transparent. 3 complete sets 
                 are included; one in red, one in blue, and the 
                 other green. Cursors are non-animated, with 
                 just the working animated (non-animated working 
                 is included). 48 cursors total. Enjoy.

           note: These cursors contain alpha-blended shading 
                 and will only look good in Windows XP or 
                 equivalent operating systems.

                        HOW TO INSTALL

  Copy all the cursors into your C:\WINDOWS\Cursors folder. 
  Open up Mouse properties from the Control Panel and select 
  the Pointers tab. You will now see a listing of all the 
  cursors currently being used. Going down the list, change 
  each one by highlighting it, clicking Browse, and selecting 
  the new cursor. When you're done you can save all changes 
  into a scheme for easy loading later.

                  PROBLEM: FLICKERING CURSORS

  On some systems animated cursors will flicker slightly under 
  Windows XP (alpha-blended or not). You can solve this problem 
  by decreasing the amount of hardware acceleration your 
  graphics card uses. Open Display properties from the control 
  panel, select the Settings tab, then Advanced, then 
  Troubleshoot. You will see a slider that goes from None to 
  Full. Experiment moving the slider back one notch at a time 
  (pressing Apply each time) until all cursor flicker stops.
